[Pictographic](https://github.com/pictographic) was launched as an independent open source project focused on experimentation with online data visualisation.  By its nature, dataviz beyond standard charts often turns out to be a bespoke task involving discovery, data wrangling, experimentation, and iteration on custom development. Managing the data that goes into a visualisation is another task. 

The content management tools we are developing for data visualisation include: 

- streaming real-time data feeds for visualisations
- capturing geographic point data for map visualisation
- generating a sparkline from a range of uploaded numbers
