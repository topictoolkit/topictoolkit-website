An intuitive interface to make relevant content findable with a few easy clicks. 

![Filter:Find](./img/filterfind.svg)


The information architecture behind _Filter:Find_ was initially designed to address a common challenge we encountered with organisations that had a growing collection of online content.  Over time, older valuable articles tended to be lost and buried by more recent press releases and current news. Blogging platforms and popular CMS platforms have a built-in recency bias - and this made it difficult for users doing deeper reading to easily find the relevant articles around a topic or area of interest. 

With user research and ongoing iteration, we made some important discoveries: 

- a fluid association of articles with collections organisation by _bottom-up topic tags_ allows for more meaningful groupings of related content than siloed, _top-down hierarchies_. 
- providing users an interface to toggle and combine topics quickly reduces the collection to something relevant  
- users were quick to gain a better understanding of the available relevant content when results were immediately presented after selecting a topic
- updating the topic selection interface with enabled topics helped speed up finding relevant content
- a vocabulary for topics that is meaningful to users is essential, but with the immediate feedback, users learn quickly
- users enjoyed exploring by clicking and toggling combinations because feedback was immediate

Information Architects, and anyone who's read the Polar Bear book will know this stuff. They call it _Faceted Navigation_. We like to call it, more directly **Filter:Find**, because that's what users do with it.
