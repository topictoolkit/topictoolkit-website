Anyone who puts their content on the web should own and control their content and how it is distributed.

 we have produced a set of plugins, apps and widgets that put you, the publisher, in control of your own content. 

 Our aim is to make it easy to communicate on the web without making you, your content or your organisation  fodder for another company's business model and advertising. 

 We beleive it is up to you what happens with your content - and that to do that you need access to the means of production.
